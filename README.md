Reverse Hangman
===============

A game I developed as a project for my web immersive course at GA, *Reverse Hangman* is a twist on the original Hangman. (I dare say, that to myself it was the original because that was how I had played it my whole life!). I had so much fun, that I have decided to continue working on this project and create many fun new themes for all to enjoy!

The Twist
---------

Instead of adding body parts every time the player guesses incorrectly, you are already hanging and body parts are dismembered! Try to save the man before it's too late. Woah. Additionally there is an *original game* feature for those that are a little squeamish. Enjoy!
